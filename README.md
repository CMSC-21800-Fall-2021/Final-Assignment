# Final-Assignment - Part
**Due: November [Insert Date] **

# Set-Up and Administration
## Code Editor
We strongly suggest that you use a Python code editor like VSCode for this assignment.

## How to Register with Git Classroom
[Insert Instructions]
You should have your own version of this git repository in your Github Account.

## Quick Introduction to Git
[Insert Instructions -> after testing these instructions]
- Git clone
- Other common commands -> you do not need this for the assignment (commits etc.)

## Experiment Explaination and Permissions
We will be tracking your code for a research project on programming behavior in data science. 

This is a link to the information on the project: [Insert pdf/google doc]

Anything outside of your personal repository will not be tracked. All personally identifying information will be removed in the final dataset.

Link to opt-out: [Insert Google Form]

# IMPORTANT: How to run your assignment
You need to install a library called GitPython. This library allows us to run git commands in Python. You can install the library by running:
[Question to Sanjay: pip3/python3 or pip/python?]

```
pip3 install GitPython
```

There is a file called run.py in this repository. After you download this repository, you will need to go to the base directory in terminal (`cd [directory name`). Every single time that you would like to run your code, you will run:

```
python3 run.py [your file] [your arguments:optional]

```

[Sanjay Check This]: This command writes to Github every single time you run your code. It allows us to have a record of your code history. Looking at your code history will only positively impact your grade. I.e. we will not dock marks on your final code based on your history, but if you show interesting intermediate steps or a valient effort at debugging something that ultimately didn't work, that could positively impact your grade.

## Aliases (Linux/Mac Only)
You can create an alias for the previous command so that you don't have to run the full string. This is easy to do in Linux. In your command terminal you can type:

```
alias py ="python3 run.py"
```

This allows you to run your program with:

```
py [your file] [your arguments:optional]

```

# Assignment Logistics
You will be [insert task]. 

For this part of the assignment, you will be filling out code in [insert file names]. All the data has been prepared in [insert folder name]. If you generate additional data and/or graphs, please save them in [insert folder name].

During your assignment, you will 
# Issues
If you run into any technical issues AT ALL for this assignment, please email: j2zhao@uchicago.edu. If you run into any issues with the `python3 run.py` command, we would prefer that you email us than try to debug on your own.

Jinjin will also be hosting additional virtual and in-person office hours for this task. The times are [INSERT OFFICE HOURS]. The first office hour is intended to help students set up their coding environment.
